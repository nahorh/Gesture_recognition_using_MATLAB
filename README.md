# Gesture_recognition_using_MATLAB
This system is implemented using deep transfer learning using Alexnet.
Alexnet is a pretained network to which only modification is made in the image input layer to give our image as an input and the output is taken from the fully connected layers and the max pooling layer. The model can classify the gesture as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 for corresponding gestures else no gesture would be detected.
